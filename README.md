## 1. Develop a task manager using Vue and Firebase. 

The task manager should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks and also have a feature to set due dates and reminders. 
The task manager should also have the ability to categorize tasks into different lists.

This code creates a task manager that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as set due dates and reminders. Tasks can also be categorized into different lists. The tasks are stored in a Firebase database and are retrieved and displayed in the Vue app.

Note: In order to use Firebase in your application, you will need to create a project in the Firebase console and add the necessary configuration to your code.


## 2. Develop the code for a user profile card built using TailwindCSS

Design a user profile card that displays information about a user, such as their name, profile picture, and social media links. Use TailwindCSS to style the card and make it responsive to different screen sizes. The card should also have the ability to display a "verified" badge and have a hover effect.
