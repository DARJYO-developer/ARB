As an AI language model, chatGPT doesn't have the capability to store any data or conversations as it don't have access to any storage systems. 
All the conversations between you andthe bot happen in real-time and are not recorded or stored anywhere.

Additionally, once you end a conversation and close the chat window, there is no way for you or anyone else to access the conversation history again.

Moreover, OpenAI, the organization behind chatGPT, takes data privacy and security very seriously. 
They have implemented various security measures to ensure that all conversations with the bot are encrypted, and the data is protected.

So, you can be confident that it doesn't store any of your data or conversations after you have cleared them.
